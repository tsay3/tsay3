### Thank you for visiting!

I am Thomas Say, and I have been programming for most of my life, from reading old books on BASIC as a kid, to coding Flash games in high school, to taking Java and C++ classes in community college, to helping build websites with PHP and SQL, to studying for a degree at the Univesity of Illinois in Chicago and aiming for a career as a web or software developer.
